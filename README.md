# smartcontracts
Ungravel is based on 4 different smart contracts and lots of proxy contracts that depend on ENS.


factory        https://app.ens.domains/factory.ungravel.eth

gwallet        https://app.ens.domains/gwallet.ungravel.eth

tokenMaster    https://app.ens.domains/tokenmaster.ungravel.eth

auctionMaster  https://app.ens.domains/auctionmaster.ungravel.eth




Watch these contracts in action on ethereum mainnet  http://ethereum.ungravel.org

or explore the testnet landing page, such as http://arbitrum.ungravel.org on arbitrum sepolia testnet.

Each bug report gets directly rooted to the lead developer and probably receives an answer once Ungravel goes live officially. (include your Ethereum mainnet account / address & your e-mail)
